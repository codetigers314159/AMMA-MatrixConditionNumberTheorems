Matlab Version: M2024b is used for this code as of 2025,
we can not help or support the use of other versions of Matlab.

This repository provides supporting MATLAB (and other) code for the paper on  
matrix condition numbers (Theorem 1 in the SIAM submission, originally Theorem 6.2).  
The paper itself refers to this index rather than to individual file names.  
All code follows the versioning and naming convention described below.

This repo is for research related to Matrix Condition Numbers, all the code 
here is not for commercial use. 

Most codes generate random matrices in Matlab for researchers to view the 
structures as defined in Theorem 1 (or 6.2 in PPT or PDF file) - of the 
Canonical block submatrices - a 2x2 block matrix of: 
1) An - an nxn submatrix of An+1, 
2) and the 2 edge vectors V1 and V2 for nx1 and 1xn and 
3) the last diagonal element a(n+1,n+1)
from an original n+1 x n+1 real matrix. See the Theorem 1 for details.

FILE ADDED: 09-21-25 BY REG
cndStructureFunction_FULL_PLOTS_ALL_UPDATEDV4_ONE_RUN.m - only runs one test matrix, with user spec values range, plots all major submatrices, user can specify min/max cond#

## File Naming Convention

CND with V#### for version - then DESCRIPTION.m  - can not have spaces - use underscore for Matlab


- MATLAB code (`.m` file)  
- CND = Condition Number research  
- V#### = version number (e.g., `V1001` or V1 = first public release)  
- DESCRIPTION = short code details, more details at the start of the m-file  

**Example:**  
`CND_V1_RandomMatrixGen.m`

## Versioning

- Older versions are never modified.  
- Each new release increments the `V####` counter.  
- This ensures reproducibility across paper references.

## Usage

Most codes allow specifying:

- Matrix size (`n x n`, real, square)  
- Range of condition numbers (min, max or just min condition number)  
- Run ID   
- Other options depending on version  

**Example MATLAB call:**

Special Matrices
Users may supply their own matrices (or use MATLAB’s gallery).
Rename MATRIX input to M or adjust code as needed in your copy for code

Generated random matrices may be saved for reproducibility.

Notes
All routines are for research and educational use.
Commercial use requires prior approval.
Planned language coverage: MATLAB, Python, and C# (separate folders).
